& \textbf{Research Assistant: University of Melbourne (Mathematics and Statistics)} \\
& Supervisors: Damjan Vukcevic and Michelle Blom \hfill September 2020 -- March 2023 \\
& I worked full-time for 7 weeks from January to March. I implemented a Bayesian model for modelling Election outcomes in R (available as an R package on CRAN: \link{https://cran.r-project.org/package=elections.dtree}{elections.dtree}). I investigated model performance using real Australian Election data by running distributed simulations on Spartan HPC. This motivated me to publish my second R package \link{https://github.com/fleverest/prefio}{\textbf{prefio}}, which makes this work (and other analyses for preferencial datasets) significantly easier for other research communities.\\
 
& \textbf{Research Assistant: Melbourne Business School} \\
& Supervisor: Michael Smith \hfill March 2021 -- November 2022 \\
& I worked casual hours during my Master of Data Science. I implemented a novel MCMC regression model for endogenous data in R \& C++.\\

& \hfill January 2018 -- December 2022 \\
& I worked part-time as a Backend Developer and Sysadmin for 4 years. My main contribution was migrating a legacy e-commerce platform to an up-to-date platform. Everything was self-hosted and there were multiple third-party applications which used the shop database. To achieve this with minimal downtime I decided to add a database for the new platform to the existing mysql server. Then, I implemented triggers to keep the relevant database tables in sync.\\
